# Equity Option Implied Volatility Analytics with Python

Notebook for 19 January PyData Singapore Meetup

Python has become an increasingly important tool in the domain of quantitative and algorithmic trading and research. This extends from senior quantitative analysts pricing complex derivatives using numerical techniques all the way to the retail trader using closed form valuation methods and analysis techniques. This talk will focus on the uses of Python in discovering unobserved features of listed equity options known as implied volatility.

In this talk, we'll learn a bit about Black-Scholes model, option pricing formula the "greeks" and how to code it all in Python. I'll then demonstrate how to gather options data using Pandas and apply various transformations to obtain the theoretical value of the option and the associated greeks. We'll then extend the talk to discuss implied volatility and show how to use Numpy methods to compute implied volatility and model missing and bad values. Finally, we'll use the results to visualize the so-called volatility skew and term structure to help inform potential trading decisions.
